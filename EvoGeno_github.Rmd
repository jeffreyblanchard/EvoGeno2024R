The course github site repository is at https://github.com/jeffreyblanchard/EvoGeno2024R

If you are not using Posit/RStudio Cloud here are directions for creating a RStudio project space that is in sync with the course github and will download the files in the repo.

* Go to https://github.com/jeffreyblanchard/EvoGeno2024R
* Click on the green code button and copy the https link (https://github.com/jeffreyblanchard/EvoGeno2024R.git)
* In RStudio click on File > New Project (You can not do this on RStudio Cloud. Only on Unity or with RStudio downloaded to your own computer)
* Select Version Control
* Select Git
* Paste in link from course github site (https://github.com/jeffreyblanchard/EvoGeno2024R.git)
* Choose the directory you want to use for the project (often /project/username)
* In the upper right corner select the git tab. Click pull when you want to update
